### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Branden Torrance. I am currently a senior at BYU-I as an online student, and I'm expecting to graduate with my Bachelor's in Applied technology, with emphasis in Software Development, at the end of December 2022. 
<br><br>
Right now, I'm currently learning about creating RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express, Render, and MongoDB. It has been a fun challenge and I look forward to learning more and being able to flesh out my API. I am also working with a team, and we will be tasked with creating a RESTful API later this semester. I am excited for the challenge to learn and grow through these assignments!
<br><br>
How did I end up here? Well, I originally was training to be a commercial pilot. I had received my private pilot's license and began working on my commercial license, but I realized that being gone from my family for multiple days a week would be too difficult, so I decided on a career change. I've always been interested in computers and software, so I decided to take a coding class, and the rest is history!
