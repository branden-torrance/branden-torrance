### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Branden Torrance. I am a recently graduated student from Brigham Young University - Idaho (BYU-I). I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology with an emphasis in Software Development. I have experience with many different technologies and languages, including HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, RESTful APIs, PHP, Python, Relational and non-relational databases (MySQL and MongoDB), and some Angular experience.
<br><br>
As for professional experience, I worked in an internship for a year with Crain Communications as a web developer intern. I worked with additional technologies, such as Drupal, Jira, and Bitbucket. Our team utilized the SCRUM methodology within the Agile framework. We would participate in daily standups and we used story points to assign the estimated effort required for each task.
<br><br>
A little bit about myself - I was originally training to be a commercial pilot. I had received my private pilot's license and began working on my commercial license, but I came to the realization that being away from my family for multiple days each week isn't what I wanted, so I decided on a career change. I've always been interested in computers and software, so I decided to take my first coding class and I was immediately hooked. I find great fulfillment in creating software and problem-solving, and I am excited to build and improve upon my coding skills throughout my career!
